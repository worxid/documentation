# Registration

To be able to use the Worx dashboard, you need to register by filling in your personal data on the Sign Up page according to the instructions below. But if you already have an account, you can immediately switch to the Sign In page via the link (marked with red/blue text) "Sign In" in the image below.

To be able to register into the Worx dashboard, you must enter your full name, email address, password, organization name, country, and phone number and ends by pressing the "Sign Up" button on the Sign Up (https://dev.worx.id/sign-up) page.
