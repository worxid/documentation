There are three sections on the modal, namely (from top to bottom) the header, content, and navigation sections. The header section has information (from left to right) on the number of media files in the answer, the order of media files being opened, the download media button, and the button for closing the modal. In the Content section, you can view the content of media files that are currently open. In the navigation section, there are "Back" and "Next" buttons to set which media files you want to open.
