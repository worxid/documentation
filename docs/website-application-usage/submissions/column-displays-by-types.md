# Column Displays By Types

There are fifteen types of columns according to the fifteen input types of the Toolbox that have been described in the previous form creation documentation. In general, all columns have similar types of data display output that can be grouped into four types, namely data displayed in the form of text and numbers, chip display, rating star display, and media button display. Especially for inputs with a Separator type, the column is not displayed in the table because there is no answer to an input with the Separator type.

## 1. Columns with Text or Number Display

Inputs with the type of text inputs, yes/no, date, time, integer, or bar/QR code on a form will generate an answer in text or number format. Answers with the text or number format will be displayed directly on the table on this Submission page using a regular text display as in some columns as shown in the image below.

## 2. Column with Chip Display

Inputs with the type of check box, radio groups, or drop-downs on a form will generate an answer with a selected options list format. Answers with the format of the selected list of options will be displayed using the Chip view in the table on this Submission page as seen in the image below.

If an answer has more than one option selected, the option that will only appear is the first option, while the rest of the options will only appear in the form of number.

## 3. Column with Star Type Rating Display

Input with the star type rating of a form will generate an answer in number format from a certain range of numbers. Answers with the number format from the range of numbers will be displayed using the appearance of the star type rating on the table on this Submissions page as seen in the image below.

## 4. Columns with Media Button Displays

Input with the type of file, photos, signatures, or sketches on a form will generate answers in media file format. The answer with format of the media file will be displayed on the table on this Submissions page in the appearance of the media button as seen in the image below.

If an answer has more than one medias, what will only appear is the first media name, while the rest of the medias will only appear in the number format.

Each column has a different icon that aims to directly indicate the type of an answer. The answers in columns with file types will have a file icon. The answers in the column with the photo type will have a photo icon. The answers to columns with signature type will have a curved line icon. The answers on the column with the sketch type have a brush icon.

You can click the buttons on each of the types above to be able to see the details of the list of submitted media files that will be described in the next explanation.
