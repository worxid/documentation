# Sort by Column

Tables come with an ascending or descending sort feature based on a column. You can use this sorting feature by clicking the button with the filter icon in the upper right corner of the table, then clicking the sorting icon next to the filter column input.

The upward arrow icon means that the table is being sorted ascendingly (the higher the index of the data row, the higher the data value) while the downward arrow icon means the table is being sorted descendingly (the higher the index of the data row, the smaller the data value).

Not all columns on a table have a column sorting feature as shown above. This is exemplified in the table on the Submissions page below, which is described later.
