# Showing or Hiding Columns

You can show or hide certain columns on a table by clicking the gear icon button in the upper right corner of the table. A menu of all columns with checkboxes will appear after you click the gear button.

A filled check box indicates that the column is being displayed while an unfilled check box indicates that the column is not being displayed.
