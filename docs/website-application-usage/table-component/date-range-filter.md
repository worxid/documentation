On the left side of the modal, there is a list of date range options. They are the last 7, 14, and 30 days from today. On the middle and right sides, there are two calendars that indicate the date range you selected. You can also select a date range through both calendars. click the "Select" button to select the final date range or click the "Cancel" button to cancel the date range selection.
