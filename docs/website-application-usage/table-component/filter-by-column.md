# Filter by Column

The table comes with a filter feature based on a column to search for a specific data. You can activate the filter feature by clicking the filter button in the upper right of the table and entering text in the column you want. The result is that the table will bring up data according to the column containing the text you entered. An example is the following image.

Not all columns in a table have a column based filter feature as shown in the image above. This is exemplified in the table on the Submissions page below, which is described in the documentation later.
