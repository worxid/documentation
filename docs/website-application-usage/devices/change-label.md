# Changing the Device Label

You can change the label of a device by selecting a device from the Devices table and then clicking the pencil icon button in the title of the detailed information panel as in the image below.

In the Device item, you can only change the label (title) and group list of a device (which will be described in the next section). There is no save or cancel button. So once you are done changing the label, the new label data from the device will be instantly stored in the database.
