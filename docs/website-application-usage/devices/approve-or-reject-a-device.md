# Approving or Rejecting a Device

The process of approving or rejecting a device will only occur if the device is still in the "Pending" status. A device can be approved or rejected from Worx by selecting the device on the table and clicking the "Reject" button to reject the device or "Approve" button to approve the device that is located on the detailed information panel of a device.

There is no confirmation process for changing the device status to approved or rejected.
