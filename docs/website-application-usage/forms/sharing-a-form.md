# Sharing a Form

You can share a form you've created by clicking the share button from the detailed information panel of a form.

Then the modal share form will appear as in the image below. There are four parts to the capital, namely (from top to bottom) the "Email" and "Link" tabs, content from one tab, shared via social media, and shared via QR code.

## 1. Sharing the Form via Email Address

On the email tab, you can share a form with multiple email addresses at once as follows. You can enter individual email addresses with the "Enter" character separator on the keyboard for each email address. After that, you need to click the "Send Form" button to share the form with all email addresses.

## 2. Sharing the Form via the Link

A form can be shared by using the link on the "Links" tab. The link to the form you want to share is directly provided by Worx. You just need to click the "Copy Link" button and the link from the form is ready for you to share outside Worx.

## 3. Sharing the Form via Social Media

To share a form via social media, you just need to click the social media button that has been provided at the bottom left of the modal as shown below. Meanwhile, Worx only provides three media products, namely Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. You will be prompted by the social media you choose to log in first before you can share the form.
