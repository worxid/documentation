# Change the Groups of a Form

A form model can be assigned to several groups or moved from a specific group. To change the group value of a form, you can click the "Change Group" button for detailed information about the form. After that, the menu for selecting groups will appear as in the image below.

You can search for a group by providing a value in a search input. Each group has a check box. An active or selected check field means that a form will be assigned to the group. While the inactive check box field means that a form will be removed from the group.
