# Creating a New Group

You can create a new group by clicking the add button on the upper left side of the screen as shown below.

Then the modal to create a new group will appear as shown in the image below.

You just need to input the group name in the name input along with a color. There is no save or cancel button. So once you have done changing the name or color of the group, the new group data will be directly stored on the database.
