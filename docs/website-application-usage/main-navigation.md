You can see a list of navigations between each page on the left side of your screen. Here is a picture of the main navigation in expanded (left) or collapsed (right) conditions.

You can change the mode of navigation to expanded or collapsed by clicking the button (next to the logo) at the top of the navigation. You can change the logo from the navigation on the Settings page. There are five page accesses provided in the navigation. The five accesses are Home, Forms, Devices, Groups, and Settings pages. You can exit the Worx website application by clicking the Log Out button.
