On the maps element, you can see the distribution of the submission locations of the form on the map (with the symbol circle which can be referred as a marker) according to the data you entered in the in the filters element and the bar item is selected on the chart. Each adjacent submission location will be grouped into the same cluster with a circle symbol larger than the marker. You can see what submissions are in a cluster by clicking the cluster until the cluster emits every marker in it. Here's the example.
