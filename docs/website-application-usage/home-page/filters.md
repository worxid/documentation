In the filters element, there are filters by form (from the list of forms), date ranges, and specific devices (from the list of devices). The initial conditions on these filters are filter with all forms, filter with date range of the last 30 hari, and filter with all devices. Here's a modal view to select the date range that will appear when you click the date input.

You can only select a maximum range of 30 days. click the "Select" button to select the final range or click the "Cancel" button to cancel the date range selection.

Each value you select in this filter element will affect the answers to the form (later called as submissions) that appears on the chart and map elements. You can reset the values of all filters by clicking the "Reset Filter" button.
